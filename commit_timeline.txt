2025-10-06 Lucas Veloso afbdad8 Back-end connection and export
2025-10-05 MagMicro aa68528 reworked update & add so that their functionality is now separated. Updated broadcast system to notify what action was done. Added the delete functionality, so assignments can now be properly deleted.
2025-10-05 MagMicro a8eb00d Added the functionality to edit assignments with a button, added lots of back end functionalities in the process, such as the ability to find and delete assignments. Currently 'stable' but needs to be thouroughly tested still.
2025-10-04 MagMicro 51d23e5 Filled in the fields for each due date notice, added styling and a basic animation to them
2025-10-04 Jacob Bennett 3310237 Created basic functionality for the display showing assignments due soon, with a scrollable bar, due date estimate (slightly off) and a colour coded system. Each new assignment is put into sorted order through the use of insertion sort.
2025-10-03 MagMicro 0f14bf4 Made a default view for textual for when there are no assignments available.
2025-10-03 MagMicro 9a76ec1 Make the scroll bars contained within their steps in the textual view, make heading bigger and added horizontal divider
2025-10-02 Jacob Bennett 87c4fce Made the dotpoint drop downs for each assignment step, with a state system that only keeps the selected step open. Changed some formating of elements and made the unit code buttons the same colour as their allocated colour. Need to still add additional resources and an option for filtering by due date

2025-10-01 limeken 4641379 Responsive changes to title and instructions button
2025-10-01 limeken d236b8b Responsive Updates and Slight Aesthetic improvements
2025-10-01 Jacob Bennett 2999ea7 Added basic structure for textual format, with unit buttons that then display their respective assignment buttons, which then display the steps associated with the specific assignment chosen. Each unit has a little checkmark to show selected, similar needs to be added to the assignments. Steps for each assignment dont show what their dotpoints are yet. Shoddy solution for assignment type added, previously not updated on modal submission.
2025-09-29 maxwell 13a1ca2 + options component + new semester interface + changed some modal stuff
2025-09-29 maxwell db29c5c Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/backend-api-sprint3' into dataprovider
2025-09-29 maxwell b5d2fdd + moved modal placement + added dummy dataprovider prop
2025-09-26 maxwell 8715d51 + modals now mount to a root-level managing element and internalise all their own logic + localised most calendar logic + some styling changes to calnedar
2025-09-24 MagMicro 665a601 chnaged how assignments are stored: now stored as a dictionary, with their unit codes as their key, colours are kept uniform amongst units. The headers for each unit grow proportionally to how many assignments they contain. Modified the calendar headers to better conform to the UWA styling.
2025-09-23 MagMicro 8e87a7a deleted a redundant file
2025-09-23 MagMicro 1b21895 Moved the textual format component inside of the calendar, so that the component isnt remounted every time.

2025-09-22 Lucas Veloso 73687a4 feat(export): PDF export MVP (assignments table + milestones)
2025-09-22 MagMicro 98cd7d3 Added a transition component to the submission modal
2025-09-22 MagMicro c4f55c3 Merged input fields into the submission modal. Split the assignment button into its own component. Eradicated ALOT of code from main, as default is no longer used (creates default objects, different from one another without state). No need for state functions anymore. Made the way the modal works completely different, passes in an empty instance of assignmentCalendar that is only updated when submission is sent. This object then gets rendered.

2025-09-20 Lucas Veloso 8c11c27 feat(api): add plan/assignment CRUD + milestone generation; wire simple API-only testing
2025-09-18 MagMicro 5b6b6a9 Hooked the state representing the different visualisation formats from a toggle component, to two new components representing the calender and textual formats. Added a placeholder animation for both of them for now. Textual format is currently empty, and calendar format has a state persistence issue where rows will disappear for ever once the format is changed to textual.
2025-09-18 MagMicro 20e643f Added working toggle bar that switches between calendar and textual formats, added animation of bar sliding between options
2025-09-18 MagMicro 4da3b42 Condensed both university banner and application header into one, made them fixed to the page, added padding on body at top of page to make room, moved the new ntoification component into the university banner
2025-09-18 MagMicro 95ad038 Created a component for confirming the outcome of adding an assignment, through a drop down banner that has alternative messages for success and failure.
2025-09-18 MagMicro f51b3d3 Removed x button, corrected position of notification dot, chnaged its size, made additional resources button bigger for readability, added comments to the modal code
2025-09-16 maxwell bdd4ef2 + then he came for the linting errors, and suddenly I had nothing left to bother me...
2025-09-16 maxwell 5908c84 + hooked modals which were unhooked + hoisted components which were unhoisted + removed some keyboard spam

2025-09-16 MagMicro dfb5747 Added a working side menu for displaying external resources with a functioning toggle button. Reworked the appearance of the main pop-up, and added some more hover animations to make the page feel less static for now.
2025-09-15 maxwell ae7de9e + added headlessui for modal + added unit name, random coloring handled in a pretty over-the-top way
2025-09-15 maxwell 5622750 + added headlessui for modal + added unit name, random coloring handled in a pretty over-the-top way
2025-09-15 MagMicro e38e02e Added comments to the Assignment PopUp function for readability, removed type double ups between component and main.
2025-09-11 MagMicro 046766f Got the entire popup working with the provided dummy object, fucntional x button now to close the popup, dot points are displayed properly with an overflow too, hard coded variables like dots are now dependent on the assignment object passed.
2025-09-11 MagMicro 030e7a4 Added foundation for pop-up, added working dots, added navigation buttonsand defined a dummy object for our only currently supported assessment

2025-09-01 Jacob Bennett 07f56db Turned the input fields into their own separated component, with required interfaces and types. Added comments throughout different components.
2025-08-28 MagMicro 3f703dc Began turning final document into invidual components
